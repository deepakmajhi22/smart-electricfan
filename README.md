Smart Electric Fan with Motion Capture and Temperature Sensing


Introduction:
The objective of this project is to develop a cutting-edge electric fan that incorporates advanced features such as motion capture and temperature sensing. By utilizing these technologies, the fan will provide enhanced functionality and an improved user experience.

Description:
The smart electric fan will be equipped with a motion capture system that utilizes sensors to detect human presence and movement within its vicinity. This feature ensures that the fan operates only when there are individuals in the room, optimizing energy efficiency and reducing unnecessary usage.

In addition, the fan will be equipped with temperature sensors to monitor the ambient temperature accurately. By doing so, it can automatically adjust its speed and airflow to maintain a comfortable environment based on the user's preferences. The temperature sensors enable the fan to respond dynamically to changes in room temperature, ensuring optimal cooling or ventilation as required.

Key Features:
1. Motion Capture System: The fan's motion capture system will detect human presence and movement within the room, activating or deactivating the fan accordingly. This feature saves energy by preventing the fan from running when not needed.

2. Temperature Sensing: Integrated temperature sensors will continuously monitor the ambient temperature. The fan will adjust its speed and airflow automatically to maintain a comfortable environment based on the user's desired temperature settings.

3. Energy Efficiency: The combination of motion capture and temperature sensing ensures optimal energy efficiency. The fan operates intelligently, reducing unnecessary usage and adapting to changing temperature conditions.

4. User-Friendly Interface: The fan will include an intuitive interface, allowing users to customize their preferred temperature settings and adjust fan speed manually if desired. This interface will also display relevant information such as room temperature and fan status.

Conclusion:
This project aims to create a smart electric fan that leverages motion capture and temperature sensing technologies. By integrating these advanced features, the fan will provide improved energy efficiency, automatic temperature control, and a convenient user experience. The result will be a more intelligent and effective cooling solution for modern environments.
